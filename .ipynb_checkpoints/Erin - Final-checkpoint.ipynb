    "### Goal\n",
    "In this project, I explore the relationship between density of formerly incarcerated individuals within a neighborhood and likelihood that prison culture becomes embedded into a neighborhood’s culture (\"prisonization\"), using an adaptation of Axelrod’s model of cultural dissemination (1997). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "Through the rise of mass incarceration over the last thirty years, American communities contain more people than ever before who have experienced incarceration. Many low-income and minority communities, disproportionately affected by tough-on-crime legislation, have particularly high concentrations of people returning home from jails and prisons. Prisons, as total institutions, tend to develop their own subcultures as their members are forced to alter their conceptions of self (Goffman 1961). Whether this prison subculture spreads to communities receiving large numbers of former inmates is unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Econometric approaches for estimating effects of incarceration on neighborhoods are generally not feasible due to multidirectional causality. An agent-based modeling approach to understanding this relationship provides bottom-up insight into understanding how influences at the individual level can cause community-level changes in culture. Through the agent-based model I am developing, I can explore the shape of the relationship between density of previously incarcerated individuals in a neighbhorhood and the likelihood that the overall neighborhood culture changes as a result of cultural traits picked up by individuals during incarceration. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome measures\n",
    "The outcome of interest in this model is the shape of the relationship between initial prisionization levels and equilibrium prisonization levels. A linear or concave relationship between these two levels indicate that there are no compounding effects of high-density incarceration on neighbhorhood culture, whereas a convex relationship indicates that prison culture can spread to the wider community once incarceration reaches some tipping point. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model outline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Space\n",
    "The space is a two-dimensional grid, where the edges wrap around to form a torus. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Agents\n",
    "The agents are individuals that reside on the grid. Each space on the grid contains an agent. Agents all have a vector of cultural traits, of which *prisonized* is one. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Classes\n",
    "The model contains three classes:\n",
    "* An *Agent* class related to agents in the model\n",
    "* A *Features* class related to cultural traits possessed by agents\n",
    "* A *Grid* class related to the space in which the agents reside\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Parameters\n",
    "The model consists of five parameters \n",
    "* *prisPct*: The initial level of prisonization\n",
    "* *gridSize*: Grid length and width\n",
    "* *numFeatures*: The number of cultural features that make up a culture\n",
    "* *numTraits*: The number of different values each cultural feature can possibly be (expect prisonization, which only has two possible values, 0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Model summary\n",
    "The model is initialized by creating a *gridSize* by *gridSize* grid, and creating  agents to populate the grid. Each agent is randomly assigned a vector indicating that agent's cultural features. *prisPct* percent of agents in the model are randomly designated as having previously been prisonized as a result of incarceration at the start of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin a single step of the model, an agent is picked at random. Next, one of that agent’s four neighbors (north, south, east, and west) is randomly chosen. Each of the agent’s features, including prisonization, is compared to those if its neighbor. If the agent has any features in common with its neighbor, the agent “interacts” with its neighbor, and takes on one of the neighbor’s randomly chosen non-shared features (including prisonization) with some probability equal to the index of similarity between the agent and the neighbor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps are repeated until the model reaches equilibrium. This occurs when all agents have either all features or no features in common with all of their neighbors, thus no further cultural contagion is possible. According to the Axelrod model, this should lead to some number of groups that are culturally homogenous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model reaches equilibrium, I calculate equilibrium proportion of agents who are prisonized. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Parameter sweep\n",
    "I choose fixed values for *gridSize*, *numFeatures* and *numTraits*, and then sweep through values between 0 and 1 of *prisPct*, with increments of 0.1. For each value of *prisPct*, I run the model 100 times. I then collect the model parameters and the equilibrium proportion of prisonized agents and explore the relationship between initial and equilibrium prisonization levels. \n"

    "\n",
    "One possible issue with my model is that it only allows for a maximum of two cultural zones at equilibrium. This is because there are only two possible values for prisonization, 0 and 1. With the setup of the Axelrod model, the maximum number of cultural zones at equilibrium is limited by the number of possible values for the cultural feature with the least number of possible values, because at equilibrium, all agents within a zone must be totally idential or totally different from all of its neighbors. Thus, there can only be at maximum one homogenous prisonized zone and one homogenous non-prisonized zone at equilibrium. A next step might be to think of prisonization as having more than two possible outcomes, and then seeing if this makes a difference in the results. It seems unlikely that this will change the overall results, but worth investigating nonetheless. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another direction I'd like to take is to try using a network setup rather than a grid setup. This will allow me to create agents with different levels of influence over their networks based on the number and strengths of social ties at model initialization. \n"
